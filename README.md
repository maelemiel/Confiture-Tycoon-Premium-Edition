# Industrial Tycoon - Game Jam Project

A resource management and industrial building game developed for a game jam, featuring environmental impact mechanics and population management.

## Overview

Industrial Tycoon is a strategic simulation game where players manage an industrial complex while balancing resource production, environmental pollution, and population requirements. The game emphasizes the tension between industrial growth and environmental sustainability.

## Core Mechanics

### Resource Management
The game features four core resources that players must carefully balance:
- **Energy**: Generated by power plants, required for industrial operations
- **Materials**: Extracted from mines, used for construction and production
- **Food**: Produced by granges, necessary to sustain population
- **Population**: Housed in residential buildings, required to operate industrial facilities

### Building System
Players can construct various types of structures:
- **Generators**: Produce energy but require population to operate (5 inhabitants per generator)
- **Mines**: Extract materials, requiring population (2 inhabitants per mine)  
- **Granges**: Produce food with minimal population requirements (1 inhabitant)
- **Houses**: Provide housing for population growth
- **Trees**: Generate oxygen and help counteract pollution

### Environmental Impact
The game includes a sophisticated pollution system:
- Industrial buildings generate pollution that spreads to neighboring tiles
- Polluted areas become uninhabitable and prevent certain constructions
- Trees can only be planted on clean soil (pollution level ≤ 5)
- Pollution propagates in a gradient pattern, affecting adjacent tiles with diminishing intensity

### Population Requirements
Each industrial building type has specific population requirements:
- Buildings require a minimum number of inhabitants to operate
- Population requirements are cumulative (multiple buildings of the same type increase total population needs)
- Players must balance industrial expansion with residential development

## Technical Architecture

### Structure System
The game uses an object-oriented structure hierarchy:
- `IStructure`: Base interface for all buildable structures
- `AHabitation`: Abstract class for residential buildings
- `AResourceProducer`: Abstract class for resource-generating buildings
- `AOxygenProducer`: Abstract class for oxygen-generating structures

### Resource Verification
The game includes comprehensive resource checking:
- Validates sufficient resources before allowing construction
- Checks population requirements alongside material costs
- Prevents placement of structures that cannot be sustained

## Game Jam Context

This project was developed as part of a game jam with the following constraints and goals:
- Limited development time requiring efficient design decisions
- Focus on core gameplay mechanics over visual polish
- Emphasis on strategic depth through resource interdependencies
- Environmental theme highlighting industrial vs. ecological balance

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler with C++11 support
- CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
- SFML library for graphics and input handling

### Compilation
```bash
cmake --build/ build
make
```

### Running
```bash
./build/bin/UltraDualDeathRun2DeluxeEditionRemastered
```

## Development Status

### Implemented Features

- ✅ Core resource management system
- ✅ Building placement and validation
- ✅ Population requirement system
- ✅ Pollution propagation mechanics
- ✅ Environmental restrictions on construction
- ✅ Resource verification for building placement

### Future Enhancements

- Enhanced UI for resource display
- Visual feedback for pollution levels
- Economic events and challenges

## Design Philosophy

The game explores themes of industrial development versus environmental responsibility, challenging players to find sustainable approaches to growth. The interconnected resource systems create meaningful strategic choices where short-term gains must be weighed against long-term sustainability.
