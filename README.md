# 🔥💀 ULTRA DUAL DEATH RUN 2 DELUXE EDITION REMASTERED 💀🔥
## *THE MOST EPIC PLATFORMER GAME IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND*

### 🚨 WARNING 🚨
This game is so intense that it may cause:
- Spontaneous controller throwing
- Excessive screaming at pixels
- Temporary loss of friendship with teammates
- Addiction to collecting shiny things
- An uncontrollable urge to jump on everything

## 🚀 Installation et compilation (FOR LEGENDS ONLY)

### Prérequis (What you need to become a gaming god)
- CMake 3.11 ou plus récent (because we're fancy like that)
- Compilateur C++17 compatible (GCC, Clang, MSVC) - Yes, we speak the ancient language of computers
- Git (for when you inevitably break everything)
- A strong heart ❤️ 
- Probably some snacks 🍕

### Compilation (The Sacred Ritual)
```bash
# Step 1: Summon the build system
cmake --build .

# Step 2: UNLEASH THE BEAST
./bin/UltraDualDeathRun2DeluxeEditionRemastered

# Alternative incantation if the first one doesn't work:
./bin/UltraDualDeathRun2

# If nothing works, try turning it off and on again ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```

## 🐛 Debug et outils (WHEN EVERYTHING BREAKS)

Pour débugger (The Art of Digital Detective Work):
```cpp
// Traditional method (boring but effective):
std::cout << "Debug: " << variable << std::endl;

// The Raylib way (sexy and on-screen):
DrawText(TextFormat("Debug: %d", variable), 10, 50, 20, RED);

// The desperate developer method:
std::cout << "IT'S ALIVE! IT'S ALIIIIVE!" << std::endl;

// The professional approach:
if (everything_is_broken) {
    std::cout << "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" << std::endl;
    system("sudo rm -rf /"); // DON'T ACTUALLY DO THIS
}
```

## 🏆 HALL OF FAME (LEGENDS WHO DARED)

*This section will be filled with the names of brave developers who survive the development process*

**Remember**: This is not just a game, it's a JOURNEY. A journey of pain, suffering, triumph, and probably way too much caffeine. ☕

**Disclaimer**: No keyboards were harmed in the making of this game (that's a lie).

**Final Warning**: Playing this game may result in an uncontrollable addiction to creating increasingly ridiculous README files.

## 🎪 EASTER EGGS

- Konami Code support (because why not?)
- Hidden developer room accessible by jumping 42 times
- Secret character: A dancing banana 🍌
- If you die 100 times, the game gives you a virtual hug 🤗

*Made with ❤️, tears, and an unhealthy amount of energy drinks*

**THE LEGEND BEGINS... NOW!** 🚀💫⭐
